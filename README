rls (Remote Login Shell client) is a program for logging into and for executing commands on a remote machine running rls-server.

Client-server communication is unencrypted. Therefore, it is strongly recommended to make sure that such a communication is between two trusted hosts over a secure network.


--- INSTALLATION ---


To install rls, please run the installation script 'install.sh' without root privileges. If it is installed already but not configured for this user, run 'config.sh' instead.

The provided Makefile has to be used only by the installation script, so refrain from running make manually.

To run rls in debugging mode (i.e. with extended verbosity) please add '-D __DEBUG' to the CFLAGS in the Makefile.

--- UNINSTALLATION ---

To uninstall rls, please run the uninstallation script 'uninstall.sh' without root privileges.

--- MANUAL ---

All the necessary documentation is provided in the rls manual pages.

rls(1)  provides usage information.

rls(7)  provides details about the internal structure and functioning of the client.

These manual pages are installed in /usr/local/share/man. Please make sure to have it in your MANPATH.
